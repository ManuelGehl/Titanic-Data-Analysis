# Titanic data analysis and survival prediction

![Titanic]()

## Overview

This repository contains my data analysis project on the iconic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview"). 

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset, often used by beginners in data science and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers on board the Titanic, including demographics and whether or not they survived. Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, I aim to uncover insights and build a predictive model to determine the probability of survival.

##Data Exploration.

## Machine learning model

Based on my analysis, I will develop a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. I experiment with different algorithms and techniques to achieve the best performance.
