## Overview

This repository contains my data analysis project on the iconic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). 

The aim is to discover the factors that impacted the survival of passengers on the Titanic and develop a predictive machine learning model based on passenger characteristics. In the end, the sinking of the Titanic is compared to other maritime disasters that occurred between the 18th and 21st centuries.

## Introduction

On April 14, 1912, 11:40 PM the RMS Titanic, during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, collided with an iceberg. This significant incident in nautical history resulted in the tragic sinking of the supposedly unsinkable vessel within just 160 minutes, causing the loss of numerous passengers and crew members. The Titanic was a monumental achievement, at 291.1 meters it was the largest moving structure of its time and had a capacity of up to 3,547 passengers. However, on the night of the sinking, there were only 2,223 people on board. It is worth mentioning that despite the capability to carry up to 64 lifeboats, the ship was only outfitted with 20, a few of which were not even completely occupied.

Today, the remains of this massive ship lie split in two, 3,840 meters below the ocean's surface, and are listed as a UNESCO World Underwater Heritage Site. The story of the legendary ship remains fascinating to this day. It is a tale of man's technological progress and his desire to overcome the limits of nature, but in the end he fails to do so.

**Description of the dataset**

The given train dataset describes a part of the passenger list of the Titanic. It consists of 891 entries and 12 features, most of which are complete, with only age, port of embarkation and cabin number missing (**Tab. 1**). 

***Table 1*** *: Description of the training set.*

|Column name|	Feature description|	Entries|	Encoding|
|-----------|--------------------|---------|----------|
|PassengerId|	Continuous index for passengers|	891	|Integers|
|Survived	|Survival|	891|	0 = Not survived, 1 = survived|
|Pclass	|Passenger class	|891|	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd , 3 = 3rd class| 
|Name|	Passenger name|	891|	String|
|Sex	|Gender of passenger|	891|	“male”, “female”|
|Age	|Age in years	|714	|Float|
|SibSp|	Number of siblings or spouses aboard|	891|	Integers|
|Parch|	Number of parents or children aboard|	891	|Integers|
|Ticket	|Ticket number|	891|	String|
|Fare|	Ticket price|	891|	Float|
|Cabin|	Cabin number|	204|	String|
|Embarked|	Port of embarkation|	889|	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton|
<br>

The distribution of the various features revealed a significant imbalance for virtually every feature (**Fig. 1**). The majority of passengers did not survive the Titanic disaster, as indicated by the overall survival rate of only 38.4%. In terms of gender, the dataset is dominated by male passengers, who make up 64.8% of the total. The majority of the passengers (55.1%) were in 3rd class, the cheapest class available on the ship, with the remainder split roughly evenly between 1st class (24.2%) and 2nd class (20.7%). Similarly, the majority of passengers (72.3%) embarked from Southampton, while 18.9% embarked from Cherbourg and only 8.6% from Queenstown. The age distribution appears to be somewhat similar to a normal distribution; however, a significant number of 177 age values are missing. The Siblings/Spouses (SibSp) and Parents/Children (Parch) features are both heavily skewed towards passengers traveling alone on the Titanic. The fare distribution is skewed to the left, with a mean fare of £32 $\pm$ £50 and a median of £14. This distribution suggests that the majority of passengers paid lower fares, as evidenced by the passenger class distribution.

<br>

**Relationship between survival and different features**

Survival rates on the Titanic were strongly associated with passenger class, fare paid, and gender, and to a lesser extent with age, number of parents/children and siblings/spouses, and port of embarkation (**Fig. 2A**). Passenger class had the highest absolute correlation coefficient with survival (−0.34) of all numerically coded features tested. The probability of survival increased successively from third class passengers with 24.2% to second class with 47.3% and first class with 63.0% (**Fig. 2B**). This behavior is most likely related to the fare paid, which had the second highest absolute correlation coefficient of 0.26 (**Fig. 2A**). In terms of correlation coefficient, the other characteristics tested had a much smaller impact on survival. The correlation between age and survival is slightly negative, with a coefficient of −0.08, indicating that younger passengers had a slightly better chance of surviving the sinking. Survival rates for men and women differ significantly, with women having almost four times the chance of survival at 74.2% compared to 18.9% for men. Interestingly, the port of embarkation seems to play a bigger role in the survival of passengers.  Passengers departing from Cherbourg had the highest survival rate at 55.4%, while those departing from Queenstown or Southampton had similar rates at 39.0% and 33.7%, respectively (**Fig. 2B**). The number of parents/children had a positive correlation coefficient of 0.08, while siblings/spouses had a negative coefficient of −0.04.

***Figure 2***: *(A) Correlation matrix showing the correlation coefficients of different features in the training data set. (B) Average survival rates with respect to different features.*
<br>

Since the survival rates were somewhat ambiguous depending on the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children, the characteristics were combined into the total number of relatives on board (**Fig. 2B**). The survival rates indicate three distinct categories depending on the presence of relatives (**Fig 3**). For individuals traveling alone, the survival rate was relatively low at 30.4%. However, the rate increased significantly for those traveling with at least one and up to three relatives, with an average survival rate of 57.9%. Traveling with more than three relatives resulted in a sharp drop in survival, with a rate of 16.1%. On average, passengers without any relatives or with more than three relatives aboard had a survival rate lower than the overall survival rate. Conversely, passengers with one to three relatives had a substantially higher survival rate.

***Figure 3*** *: Average survival rates according to the number of relatives on board.*
<br>

The port of embarkation appears to have a significant impact on passenger survival rates. The higher survival rates among passengers boarding at Cherbourg can be attributed to secondary factors.. Passengers embarking at Cherbourg paid an average fare of £60 and travelled predominantly in first class, whereas those embarking at Queenstown and Southampton paid much lower fares, averaging £13 and £27 respectively, and travelled predominantly in third class (**Fig. 4**).

***Figure 4*** *: Average fare paid and most common passenger class selected by passengers embarking at different ports.*
<br>
 
The role of age in terms of survival is somewhat ambiguous. On one hand, passengers aged 0 to 5 had a significantly higher survival rate of 70.5%, compared to the overall average of 38.4% (**Fig. 5A**). On the other hand, the survival rate for most age groups is evenly distributed around the overall average without displaying any discernible pattern. A notable exception is the group of passengers aged 10-15, who exhibit a heightened survival rate of 57.9% in comparison to the overall value. This phenomenon can be explained by the synergistic effects of passenger class, paid fare, and number of relatives, as all these values are somewhat higher than the overall average of passengers (**Fig. 5B**). Therefore, it is probable that the higher survival rate for these passengers is a result of sampling.

***Figure 5*** *: (A) Average survival rate for different age groups. (B) Average characteristic values and fares paid by total passengers (orange) and passengers aged 10-15 (blue).*
<br>

Taken together, passenger class, gender, age, the number of siblings/spouses, the number of parents/children, the number of relatives, the fare paid, and the port of embarkation contributed to the survival chance of a passenger, albeit to varying degrees. The strongest contributors were gender, fare paid, and the resulting passenger class. In the next step, all these features were used in different combinations to test different machine learning models to classify whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster.

### [Machine Learning Model Building](https://github.com/ManuelGehl/Titanic-data-analysis/blob/main/titanic_model_building.ipynb)

**Data Transformation and Screening**

In preparation for the machine learning model, the datasets were transformed (**Tab. 2**). First, the passenger ID, the ticket number, the cabin number, and the name of the passenger were dropped, as they did not provide any useful contribution to survival. Then, a pipeline was constructed that first imputed the numeric columns ("Age", "Fare") with the corresponding means and the categorical columns ("Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked") with the corresponding most frequent category. After the imputation step, the number of siblings/spouses was added to the number of parents/children and transformed into a new column named "Relatives". Relatives were categorized into 3 bins with 0 relatives, 1-3 relatives, and more than 3 relatives, while age was categorized into 2 bins with 0-10 years and more than 10 years. Both categorizations were done according to the different survival rates of the categories as described above (see **Fig. 3** and **Fig. 5A**). Finally, the numerical features were standard scaled and the categorical features were one-hot encoded. 

***Table 2*** *: Preprocessing steps used to transform the datasets. The steps for preprocessing are arranged vertically, while the various columns of the datasets are arranged horizontally. \*The continuous values of Age and Relatives were also subject to standard scaling.*

|Preprocessing step|PassengerID, Ticket, Cabin, Name|Age*|Fare|Pclass|Sex|SibSp|Parch|Embarked|Relatives*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Dropped| | | | | | | | |
|2||Imputation (Mean)|Imputation (Mean)|Imputation (Frequency)|Imputation (Frequency)|Imputation (Frequency)|Imputation (Frequency)|Imputation (Frequency)||
|3| | | | | | | | |Combined SibSp + Parch|
|4| |Categorized: 0-10 and > 10 years| | | | | | |Categorized: 0, 1-3 and >3 relatives|
|5| |One-hot encoded|Standard scaled|One-hot encoded|One-hot encoded|Standard scaled|Standard scaled|One-hot encoded|One-hot encoded|
<br>

Different subsets of the transformed dataset were trained with 5 different models to determine the best performing feature combination and  (**Tab. 3**). The base set consisted of the features “Fare” (continuous), ”Pclass” (categorical), “Sex” (categorical), “Embarked” (categorical) and were the common features of all subsets. Subset 1 additionally contained “Age” (continuous) and “Relatives” (continuous). Subset 2 was the base set plus “Age” (categorical younger and older than 15 years) and “Relatives” (categorical 0, 1-3 and >3 relatives). Subset 3 expanded the base set with the variables "Parch" (continuous) and "SibSp" (continuous) to account for the two distinct types of relatives present in the dataset. For the screening a support vector classifier (SVC), a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, a random forest classifier, a gradient boosting classifier (GBC) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 2 hidden layers and 100 neurons each with default parameters were used.

***Table 3*** *: Combinations of features used in various datasets to screen machine learning models.*

|Subset|Fare (continuous)|Pclass (categorical)|Sex (categorical)|Embarked (categorical)|Age (continuous)|Age (categorical)|Relatives (continuous)|Relatives (categorical)|Parch (continuous)|SibSp (continuous)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Base set|✖|✖|✖|✖|||||||
|Subset 1|✖|✖|✖|✖|✖||✖|||
|Subset 2|✖|✖|✖|✖||✖||✖||
|Subset 3|✖|✖|✖|✖|||||✖|✖|
<br>

The screening of various machine learning models across different datasets revealed that the inclusion of the number of relatives and age proved beneficial for all models and that the top-performing models included the SVC, the GBC, and the MLP (**Tab. 4**). On the base dataset, SVC achieved the highest accuracy, averaging 81.4% ± 2.9, closely followed by KNN with an accuracy of 80.4% ± 3.2. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting also demonstrated competitive performance, with accuracies of 81.0% ± 4.4 and 80.9% ± 4.0, respectively. MLP achieved a comparable accuracy of 80.4% ± 2.6. Subset 1 showcased Gradient Boosting as the leading model, achieving an accuracy of 83.4% ± 4.4, surpassing its baseline performance. SVC also improved on Subset 1 with an accuracy of 82.7% ± 3.9, while MLP achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 80.7% ± 3.6. In Subset 2, Gradient Boosting continued to excel with an accuracy of 83.4% ± 4.1. SVC and MLP reached accuracies of 82.2% ± 3.3 and 82.0% ± 3.2, respectively. Subset 3 demonstrated a slight decrease in performance for all models compared to previous subsets. SVC led with an accuracy of 80.8% ± 2.5, followed closely by KNN and Gradient Boosting with accuracies of 79.7% ± 4.3 and 80.8% ± 4.7, respectively. Random Forest and MLP displayed similar performance with accuracies of 79.1% ± 5.0 and 80.6% ± 4.3, respectively. Notably, Subset 3 included the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children as separate features, which did not universally benefit all models, resulting in the lowest average subset accuracy of 80.2% among all subsets. Subset 2, with an average accuracy of 82.3%, performed the best, indicating that the categorical versions of "Age" and "Relatives" were better learned by the models. Consequently, Subset 2 was selected for subsequent experiments, and the three top-performing models were chosen: Gradient Boosting Classifier, MLP, and SVC.

**Fine-tuning and evaluation on the test set**

Two approaches were used to fine-tune the models. In the first approach, the fast SVC and GBC were optimized using a randomized search with 5-fold cross-validation. For the MLP, the number of hidden layers was set to 2, and the number of neurons, activation function, and learning rate were tuned using the Keras Hypertuner (**Tab. 5**). For the SVC model, the best parameters were a regularization parameter C of 4.95, uniform class weights, and a polynomial kernel function of degree 2.  The optimized model yielded a mean test score of 83.4% ±2.0. The best parameters for the gradient boosting classifier were a learning rate of 0.16, a logarithmic loss, and 223 boost stages, resulting in a mean test score of 83.3% ± 2.2. For the MLP, the best hyperparameters found were 272 units per hidden layer, ReLU as the activation function, and a learning rate of 0.02, resulting in a validation accuracy of 83.2%.

The evaluation was conducted by predicting the survival of passengers in the provided test set, and subsequently submitting the forecasts to Kaggle.com for scoring (**Tab. 5**). The SVC performed best with an accuracy of 78.2%, followed by the GBC with 76.8% and the MLP with 76.3%. Considering that the overall survival rate for the training set is 38.4% and a dummy classifier would score 61.6%, the models show substantial performance. However, it is noteworthy that the accuracies on the test set are about 6% lower than those measured by k-fold cross-validation on the training and validation sets, respectively. This may indicate a sample consistency problem between the training and test data sets.

***Table 5*** *: Fine tuning results. Accuracy is calculated over the entire training dataset using 5-fold cross-validation for the SVC and GBC. For the MLP, 20% of the training dataset was separated into a validation dataset, which was used to calculate the accuracy. The score on the test dataset was obtained from Kaggle after submitting the predictions made by the models.*

|---|---|---|---|
|Support Vector Classifier|C = 4.95 <br> class_weights = None <br> kernel = „poly“|83.4% $\pm$ 2.0|78.2%|

After analyzing the correlation between diverse passenger characteristics and their chances of survival, and constructing three robust models to predict the outcome, the sinking of the Titanic was contextualized among other maritime catastrophes.

### [Investigation of other maritime disasters](https://github.com/ManuelGehl/Titanic-data-analysis/blob/9a4c93261a217d8b76f40df6b3b510275c2b78f4/titanic_maritime_disasters.ipynb)

The analysis of maritime disasters during the period from 1897 to 1927 reveals that the majority of these disasters had fewer than 200 casualties, with the bottom half of events having fewer than 149 casualties (**Tab. 6**). However, the range between the minimum and maximum casualties is wide, spanning from 37 to 1496 fatalities. Notably, the sinking of the Titanic stands out with 1496 fatalities, confirming its exceptional nature within the given time frame. Since the Titanic sinking was the biggest maritime disaster of its generation, the subsequent analysis focused on contextualizing it with previous and current maritime disasters from the 18th century onwards.

***Table 6*** *: Statistical characteristics for maritime disasters covering the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.*

|     Century    |     Mean    |     Stdev    |     Median    |     Min    |     Max    |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Titanic period (1897-1927) | 300.4 | 330.4 | 149.0 | 37 | 1496 |
|     18th    |     515.6    |     662.5    |     269.0    |     86    |     3500    |
|     19th    |     283.4    |     242.9    |     220.0    |     14    |     1600    |
|     20th    |     272.2    |     445.9    |     128.5    |     20    |     4386    |
|     21st    |     152.5    |     267.2    |     53.5    |     2    |     1864    |


The analysis of maritime disasters from the 18th to the 21st century suggests a declining trend in their severity with decreases in both mean and median casualties (**Tab. 6**). However, significant variability can be observed across all centuries, as the standard deviation exceeds the mean. Large-scale disasters with over 1,000 casualties are rare, representing only 4.2% of all maritime disasters (**Fig. 6**). However, despite their low frequency, these catastrophic incidents contribute to roughly one-fourth of all fatalities in the dataset. The sinking of the Titanic constitutes 1.3% of all peacetime deaths resulting from maritime disasters occurring between the 18th century and the present. This demonstrates the tremendous scale of the event. If the Titanic had carried 3,547 passengers at full capacity, and with a reported survival rate of 38.4%, it would have been the largest disaster involving a single ship and the third largest maritime disaster. The only two events that exceeded this hypothetical case were the sinking of the Doña Paz and the fleet under Admiral Graves. The Doña Paz incident involved the ferry of the same name and an oil tanker, while Admiral Graves' fleet consisted of at least 13 ships (**Fig. 6**).

***Figure 6*** *: Time line of maritime disasters from 1700 to 2023 with corresponding deaths. The Doña Paz and the fleet under Admiral Graves are the two largest events in terms of casualties, involving at least two ships. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the biggest disasters, claiming 1,492 lives. However, had the Titanic been fully occupied, it would have been the deadliest single-ship disaster in history.*
